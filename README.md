Problems solved according to my understanding and web references. Meaningful suggestions will be appreciated
                                                                                                          
This is one of the greatest books for beginners in quantum computing, in my opinion, especially for those who might feel intimidated by the abundance of complicated online resources. The book's Analogies section, which simplified complicated topics for laypeople, was its strongest point. The majority of the book's issues are resolved below with little to no prior knowledge required, and repeated reads of the book made nearly every topic easier. I want to thank Dr. Hiu Yung Wong for ensuring that everyone may access quantum education.
